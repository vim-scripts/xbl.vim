Syntax highlighting for Extensible Binding Language (XBL). The main purpose of the script is to syntax highlight javascript code contained in CDATA blocks.

The script is a hack; my understanding of VIM scripting is almost nil. I look forward to improvements made by anyone.

To have vim detect the file type from files with the .xbl extension,
just add the following two lines to the "filetype.vim" file in the
directory that contains the "syntax" directory:

" XBL
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.xbl   setf xbl

To have xbl syntax coloration appear in the syntax drop-down menu, just
add the line:
 
an 50.120.240 &Syntax.WXYZ.XBL :cal SetSyn("xbl")<CR>

to the "synmenu.vim" file (the value 240 in 50.120.240 might differ
according to what is already in your own file).

-- Thanks to Xavier Grosjean <xavcap AT c-est-simple DOT com> for
information on file type detection and menu updating.

Use ":set syntax=xbl" to turn it on for non-xbl files after the file is opened.
